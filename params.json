This data can be used for fueling research, however the companies sell the data, becoming a roadblock for research. To catalyze the process we’ve crafted an android application that records the data used by a person on wifi & cellular network. This data is pushed on the server where it is collected & open sourced for further analytics.\r\n\r\n### Roadmap\r\n1. Improve Android App add Geolocation data point\r\n2. Improve visualization\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the App or have a suggestion to make project better?
